## Project Description
10x-city is a web-based system designed for tourists, enabling quick searching and gathering of information about city attractions. The application uses GPT-4.1-mini API to generate attraction recommendations based on popularity criteria and mentions in various sources.

**Problem Statement:** Tourists struggle with finding and cataloging information about interesting places, events, or buildings in cities, which is time-consuming and requires manual data collection.

**Solution:** 10x-city streamlines this process by automatically generating recommendations for city attractions, allowing users to review, edit, and save these recommendations for future reference.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP 8
- **Database:** MySQL 5
- **AI Integration:** GPT-4.1-mini API
